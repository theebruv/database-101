## Week 1: Introduction to Databases

### Course Overview

Imagine you're organizing a massive library with millions of books. You need a system to:

-   Store books in an organized way
-   Find any book quickly
-   Add new books without chaos
-   Update book information
-   Remove books when needed

That's exactly what databases do with digital information! This course teaches you two main approaches:

**Relational Databases (SQL)**: Like a well-organized library with:

-   Books sorted into categories (tables)
-   A card catalog system (relationships between tables)
-   Strict rules about where everything goes (structure)
-   Examples: Customer information, bank records, school grades

**NoSQL Databases**: Like a flexible storage system that can handle:

-   Different types of items (documents, images, videos)
-   Changing requirements (no fixed structure)
-   Massive amounts of data spread across multiple locations
-   Examples: Social media posts, product catalogs, sensor data

You'll learn to "speak" to these databases using special languages (SQL and NoSQL queries) and build real projects through labs, assignments, and a final case study.

### Software Requirements

-   **Operating System**: Windows is recommended for local development, but you can use other systems like macOS or Linux.
-   **Tools**:
    -   **PgAdmin**: Used for SQL and relational databases (like PostgreSQL).
    -   **MongoDB**: Used for NoSQL databases.
-   **Helpful Resources**:
    -   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): Beginner-friendly tutorials for SQL and more.
    -   [AWS Workshops](https://workshops.aws/): Practical guides for cloud database tools.

### What is SQL?

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is like learning to speak to a database. Just as you might ask a librarian "Can you find me all books by Stephen King published after 2010?", SQL lets you ask a database questions like "Show me all students with grades above 85."

**Real-world analogy**: Imagine SQL as a universal translator between you and a very organized, but literal-minded assistant who manages your data. This assistant can:

-   **Store new information**: "Please add this new student to our records"
-   **Find specific data**: "Show me all students in Computer Science"
-   **Update existing records**: "Change John's grade from B to A"
-   **Remove outdated information**: "Delete all records from students who graduated"
-   **Organize and summarize**: "Count how many students are in each major"

**Simple example**: A student database table might look like this:

```
| Student_ID | Name    | Major           | Grade |
|------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| 001        | Alice   | Computer Science| A     |
| 002        | Bob     | Mathematics     | B+    |
| 003        | Carol   | Computer Science| A-    |
```

With SQL, you could ask: "Show me all Computer Science students" and get Alice and Carol's information instantly.

### SQL Background

-   **Purpose**: SQL is used to manage **relational databases**, where data is organized in tables with defined relationships.
-   **History**: Developed by IBM in the 1970s and standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
-   **Uses**: Widely used in data analysis, software development, data science, and data engineering.

### Database Management Systems (DBMS)

A **DBMS** is software that acts like a bridge between users (or applications) and the database. It lets you run queries to interact with data. There are two main types:

1. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**:
    - Stores data in structured tables with rows and columns.
    - Uses SQL for queries.
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.
2. **NoSQL DBMS**:
    - Handles flexible, non-tabular data (like documents or graphs).
    - Doesn’t rely only on SQL; uses other query methods.
    - Examples: MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB.

Choosing a DBMS depends on:

-   **Data Complexity**: Simple tables or varied data types?
-   **Scalability**: How much data will you store?
-   **Data Types**: Structured (tables) or unstructured (documents, graphs)?

### Relational Data Model

-   **Developed**: By IBM in 1970.
-   **Key Concepts**:
    -   **Tables**: Represent entities (e.g., "Students" table for student data).
        -   **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row (e.g., `student_id`).
        -   **Rows (Tuples)**: Individual records (e.g., one student’s data).
        -   **Columns (Attributes)**: Characteristics of the entity (e.g., `name`, `age`).
    -   **Keys**:
        -   **Primary Key**: Ensures each row is unique (e.g., no two students have the same `student_id`).
        -   **Foreign Key**: Links tables by referencing a primary key in another table (e.g., a `class_id` in the "Students" table links to the "Classes" table).
    -   **Integrity Rules**:
        -   **Entity Integrity**: Primary keys can’t be null (empty).
        -   **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys must match a valid primary key in another table or be null.
-   **Popularity**: Relational models are the most common, but NoSQL is gaining traction for flexibility.

### NoSQL Data Models

NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and flexibility, handling data that doesn’t fit neatly into tables. They include:

-   **Document**: Stores data as JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB).
-   **Graph**: Stores data as nodes and edges for relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
-   **Key-Value**: Stores data as simple key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).
-   **Example (Key-Value)**: A key like `student_001` might point to a value like `name: John, age: 20`.

### Other Data Models

Less common models include:

-   **Hierarchical**: Data in a tree-like structure (parent-child, like a family tree). Used in older systems like IBM’s IMS.
-   **Network**: Allows multiple parent-child links, more flexible but complex.
-   **Object-Oriented**, **Flat**, **Context**, **Semantic**: Specialized models not covered in this course.

### Basic SQL Queries

Think of SQL queries as polite requests to your database assistant. Just like you might ask a librarian "Could you please show me all books by Shakespeare?", you ask the database "Could you please show me all students in Computer Science?"

**The CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) - the four basic things you can do with data:

-   **CREATE TABLE**: Builds a new table (like setting up a new filing cabinet with labeled drawers).

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Students (
        student_id INT,
        first_name VARCHAR(255),
        last_name VARCHAR(255)
    );
    ```

    _Explanation_: Creates a table called `Students` with three columns:

    -   `student_id` (INT = integer/whole number)
    -   `first_name` (VARCHAR(255) = text up to 255 characters)
    -   `last_name` (VARCHAR(255) = text up to 255 characters)

    Think of this as creating a spreadsheet with column headers ready for data.

-   **DROP TABLE**: Deletes a table.
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE Students;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Removes the `Students` table entirely.
-   **SELECT**: Retrieves data (like asking "Show me what's in the filing cabinet").

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Students;
    ```

    _Explanation_: Gets all columns (`*` means "everything") from the `Students` table. The `;` marks the end of the query (like a period at the end of a sentence).

    **What you might see:**

    ```
    | student_id | first_name | last_name |
    |------------|------------|-----------|
    | 1          | Alice      | Johnson   |
    | 2          | Bob        | Smith     |
    ```

-   **SELECT with Conditions**:
    ```sql
    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Students WHERE age > 20;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Gets `first_name` and `last_name` for students older than 20.
-   **SELECT with Sorting**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY age DESC;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Gets all student data, sorted by `age` in descending order (`DESC`).
-   **INSERT**: Adds new data (like filing a new document in the cabinet).

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Students (student_id, first_name, last_name, age)
    VALUES (5, 'John', 'Doe', 20);
    ```

    _Explanation_: Adds a new student record with specific information:

    -   Student ID: 5
    -   First name: John
    -   Last name: Doe
    -   Age: 20

    **Important**: The order of values must match the order of column names you specify!

-   **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data (like correcting information in a file).

    ```sql
    UPDATE Students SET age = 25 WHERE student_id = 3;
    ```

    _Explanation_: Changes the `age` to 25 for the student with `student_id=3`.

    **Be careful!** Always use WHERE to specify which record to update. Without WHERE, you'd change ALL students' ages to 25!

-   **DELETE**: Removes data (like shredding a document).

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Students WHERE student_id = 3;
    ```

    _Explanation_: Permanently removes the student with `student_id=3` from the database.

    **Warning!** This is permanent! Always double-check your WHERE condition. Without WHERE, you'd delete ALL students!

## Week 2: Advanced SQL and Database Structures

### Database Warehouses

A **data warehouse** is a special database designed for analyzing large amounts of data, unlike operational databases (RDBMS/NoSQL) that handle daily transactions. Data warehouses use **denormalized schemas** (like Star or Snowflake) to make complex queries faster for reporting and analytics.

-   **Star Schema**: A central "fact" table (e.g., sales data) connected to "dimension" tables (e.g., products, customers).
-   **Snowflake Schema**: A more complex version of Star, with dimension tables broken into sub-tables for efficiency.

### Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

-   **Purpose**: Handles many short, fast operations like inserting, updating, or deleting data (e.g., retail purchases, banking transactions).
-   **Features**: Uses RDBMS, frequent incremental backups (every few hours or minutes).

### Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)

-   **Purpose**: Analyzes complex data for insights (e.g., data mining, business reports).
-   **Features**: Less frequent backups (daily, monthly, or yearly), optimized for multidimensional analysis.

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

**ETL** moves data from OLTP databases to OLAP data warehouses:

1. **Extract**: Pull data from the source (e.g., a retail database).
2. **Transform**: Clean or reformat data for analysis.
3. **Load**: Store data in the data warehouse.
   Many tools automate ETL, covered in Week 4.

### SQL Command Categories

SQL commands are grouped into:

-   **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manages data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
-   **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`).
-   **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Manages permissions (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).

### Aggregate Functions

**Aggregate functions** are like having a calculator that works on entire columns of data. Instead of looking at individual records, they give you summary information about groups of data.

**Think of it like analyzing a class of students:**

-   **COUNT**: "How many students are in the class?"

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students FROM Students;
    ```

    _Result_: `total_students: 25` (counts all rows)

-   **SUM**: "What's the total of all test scores?"

    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(test_score) AS total_points FROM Students;
    ```

    _Result_: `total_points: 2150` (adds up all test scores)

-   **AVG**: "What's the average age of students?"

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(age) AS average_age FROM Students;
    ```

    _Result_: `average_age: 20.5` (calculates the mean)

-   **MAX/MIN**: "Who's the oldest and youngest?"
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(age) AS youngest_age, MAX(age) AS oldest_age FROM Students;
    ```
    _Result_: `youngest_age: 18, oldest_age: 24`

**Real-world example**: A store manager might ask:

-   "How many products do we have?" (COUNT)
-   "What's our total inventory value?" (SUM of price × quantity)
-   "What's the average product price?" (AVG)

### Nested Queries (Subqueries)

**Subqueries** are queries inside other queries for complex results:

-   **Example**:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE class_id = (
        SELECT class_id
        FROM Students
        GROUP BY class_id
        ORDER BY COUNT(student_id) DESC
        LIMIT 1
    );
    ```

    _Explanation_: Finds students in the most populated class. The inner query counts students per class, sorts by count, and limits to one class ID.

-   **Complex Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT class_name
    FROM Classes
    WHERE id IN (
        SELECT class_id
        FROM Students
        GROUP BY class_id
        HAVING COUNT(id) > (
            SELECT COUNT(id)
            FROM Students
            WHERE class_id = (
                SELECT id FROM Classes WHERE class_name = 'English'
            )
        )
    );
    ```
    _Explanation_: Returns classes with more students than the "English" class. `HAVING` filters aggregate results.

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

**CTEs** create temporary result sets for cleaner, more readable queries:

-   **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...)
    AS (
        -- CTE query
    )
    -- Main query
    ```
-   **Example**:
    ```sql
    WITH AverageAge AS (
        SELECT AVG(age) AS avg_age FROM Students
    )
    SELECT first_name, last_name, age
    FROM Students, AverageAge
    WHERE age > AverageAge.avg_age;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Finds students older than the average age, using a CTE to compute the average.

### Window Functions

**Window functions** calculate values for each row based on a "window" of related rows:

-   **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, amount, SUM(amount)
    OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_id) AS running_total
    FROM Orders
    ORDER BY customer_id, order_id;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Calculates a running total of order amounts per customer, partitioned by `customer_id`.

### Handling NULL Values

**NULL** means missing data. Handle it with:

-   **Check for NULL**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE age IS NULL;
    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE age IS NOT NULL;
    ```
-   **Update NULL**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE Students SET last_name = 'Smith' WHERE last_name IS NULL;
    ```
-   **CASE for Display**:
    ```sql
    SELECT CASE
        WHEN first_name IS NULL THEN 'Unknown First Name'
        ELSE first_name
    END
    FROM Students;
    ```

### String Operations

**String operations** manipulate text:

-   **CONCAT**: Joins strings (e.g., `SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World');` → `Hello World`).
-   **LENGTH**: Counts characters (e.g., `SELECT LENGTH('Hello');` → `5`).
-   **UPPER/LOWER**: Changes case (e.g., `SELECT UPPER('hello');` → `HELLO`).
-   **TRIM**: Removes spaces (e.g., `SELECT TRIM('   HELLO   ');` → `HELLO`).
-   **SUBSTRING**: Extracts part of a string (e.g., `SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5);` → `Hello`).
-   **REPLACE**: Replaces text (e.g., `SELECT REPLACE('Hello World', 'World', 'Everyone');` → `Hello Everyone`).
-   **POSITION**: Finds text position (e.g., `SELECT POSITION('World' IN 'Hello World');` → `7`).

### Date and Time Operations

**Date/time functions** handle dates:

-   **NOW**: Current date/time (e.g., `SELECT NOW();` → `2023-07-27 12:34:56`).
-   **DATE/TIME**: Extracts date or time (e.g., `SELECT DATE(NOW());` → `2023-07-27`).
-   **DATE_ADD**: Adds time (e.g., `SELECT DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);` → next day).
-   **DATEDIFF**: Days between dates (e.g., `SELECT DATEDIFF('2023-07-28', '2023-07-27');` → `1`).
-   **TIMESTAMPDIFF**: Time difference (e.g., `SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, '2023-07-27 12:34:56', '2023-07-27 12:54:56');` → `20`).

### SQL Joins

**Joins** combine data from multiple tables:

-   **INNER JOIN**:
    ```sql
    SELECT A.column_1, B.column_2
    FROM table_1 A
    INNER JOIN table_2 B ON A.student_id = B.student_id;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Returns rows with matching `student_id` in both tables. `A` and `B` are aliases for clarity.
-   **Other Joins**:
    -   **LEFT JOIN**: All rows from the left table, matching rows from the right.
    -   **RIGHT JOIN**: All rows from the right table, matching rows from the left.
    -   **FULL JOIN**: All rows from both tables, with matches where available.
    -   **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself.
    -   **NON-EQUI JOIN**: Uses non-equality conditions (e.g., `A.column_1 < B.column_2`).
-   **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT classes.class_name
    FROM Classes LEFT JOIN Students ON classes.id = students.class_id
    WHERE students.id IS NULL;
    ```
    _Explanation_: Finds classes with no students.

### SQL Views

**Views** are virtual tables based on a query, acting like permanent CTEs:

-   **Create View**:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW StudentInfo AS
    SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, enrolled
    FROM Students
    WHERE enrolled = 1;
    ```
-   **Update View**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW StudentInfo AS
    SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, class, enrolled
    FROM Students
    WHERE enrolled = 1;
    ```
-   **Drop View**:
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW StudentInfo;
    ```
-   **Benefits**: Simplifies queries, enhances security by limiting data access, ensures consistency.
-   **Limitations**: Slower for complex queries, read-only, dependent on underlying tables.

### SQL Indexes

**Indexes** are like the index at the back of a textbook - they help you find information quickly without reading every page. In databases, they speed up searches but take extra space and time to maintain.

**Real-world analogy**: Imagine a library with two systems:

-   **Without index**: To find a book, you'd have to check every shelf (slow)
-   **With index**: You check the card catalog first, then go directly to the right shelf (fast)

**How indexes work:**

-   Database creates a separate "lookup table" pointing to actual data locations
-   When you search, it checks the index first, then jumps to the exact location
-   Like having a phone book organized alphabetically vs. random order

**Types of Indexes:**

**1. Clustered Index** - The "Main Organization System"

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
```

-   **Analogy**: Like organizing books on shelves by their call numbers
-   **How it works**: Actually rearranges the table data in sorted order
-   **Limitation**: Only one per table (you can't organize the same books in two different orders simultaneously)
-   **Best for**: Primary keys, frequently searched columns
-   **Example**: Student records sorted by student_id

**2. Non-Clustered Index** - The "Reference System"

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
```

-   **Analogy**: Like having multiple card catalogs (by author, by subject, by year)
-   **How it works**: Creates separate lookup tables that point to the actual data
-   **Advantage**: Can have many per table
-   **Best for**: Frequently searched columns that aren't the primary key
-   **Example**: Separate indexes for student name, email, and major

**When to use indexes:**

-   ✅ **Use when**: Frequently searching/filtering on a column
-   ✅ **Use when**: Joining tables on specific columns
-   ❌ **Avoid when**: Table has frequent inserts/updates (indexes slow these down)
-   ❌ **Avoid when**: Column values change frequently

**Trade-offs to remember:**

-   **Faster SELECT queries** ⚡ vs **Slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE** 🐌
-   **Faster searches** 🔍 vs **More storage space needed** 💾

## Week 3: Database Architecture

### What is Database Architecture?

**Database architecture** refers to the tools, technologies, and design choices used to store, manage, and access data. It’s like planning a house: you decide the layout based on needs like size, speed, and reliability.

### Factors Affecting Architecture

Think of these as the "requirements" you'd give to an architect before designing a building:

**1. Data Size** - "How big is your collection?"

-   **Small**: Personal photo collection (hundreds of files) → Simple local database
-   **Medium**: Company customer database (thousands of records) → Single server database
-   **Large**: Social media platform (billions of posts) → Distributed database across multiple servers
-   **Example**: A small business might use a simple database file, while Netflix needs massive distributed systems

**2. Data Type** - "What kind of stuff are you storing?"

-   **Structured**: Like a filing cabinet with labeled folders (SQL databases)
    -   Example: Employee records with fixed fields (name, ID, salary, department)
-   **Unstructured**: Like a storage room with boxes of different shapes (NoSQL databases)
    -   Example: Social media posts, images, videos, comments of varying formats

**3. Performance** - "How fast do you need answers?"

-   **Real-time**: Gaming, trading systems (milliseconds matter)
-   **Interactive**: Web applications (under 1 second)
-   **Batch**: Reports, analytics (minutes or hours is fine)
-   **Example**: A bank transfer needs instant response, but a monthly report can take time

**4. Scalability** - "Will this grow?"

-   **Vertical scaling**: Buying a bigger, more powerful computer (like upgrading your laptop)
-   **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more computers (like having multiple laptops work together)
-   **Example**: A startup might start small but need to handle millions of users later

**5. Reliability** - "How bad is it if this breaks?"

-   **Mission-critical**: Hospital systems, banking (99.99% uptime required)
-   **Business-critical**: E-commerce sites (99.9% uptime)
-   **Nice-to-have**: Personal blog (99% uptime is fine)
-   **Example**: An airline reservation system can't go down, but a personal website can

**6. Concurrency** - "How many people at once?"

-   **Single user**: Personal applications
-   **Small team**: Department databases (10-100 users)
-   **Enterprise**: Company-wide systems (1,000+ users)
-   **Internet scale**: Public websites (millions of users)
-   **Example**: A personal budget app vs. Facebook

### Database Architecture Tiers

Think of tiers like floors in a building - each floor has a specific purpose and they work together:

-   **Single-Tier**: Like a one-room apartment - everything (app and data) on one machine.

    -   **Example**: A simple desktop app with a local database file
    -   **Pros**: Simple, fast for small use
    -   **Cons**: Hard to share, doesn't scale well

-   **Two-Tier**: Like a house with a basement - App on client, database on server.

    -   **Example**: A company app on your computer connecting to a shared database server
    -   **Pros**: Better than single-tier, can share data
    -   **Cons**: Gets slow with many users

-   **Three-Tier**: Like a modern office building - Separates UI, application logic, and data for scalability.
    -   **Example**: A web application (like online banking)
    -   **Floor 1 (Presentation)**: What you see (website, mobile app)
    -   **Floor 2 (Application)**: Business logic (processing your requests)
    -   **Floor 3 (Data)**: Database storage
    -   **Pros**: Very scalable, secure, maintainable
    -   **Cons**: More complex to set up
    -   **External Schema (User View)**: What users see, customized by access level.
    -   **Conceptual Schema**: Logical view of tables, relationships, and constraints.
    -   **Internal Schema**: Physical storage details (e.g., data blocks, indexes).
    -   **Learn More**: [Three-Level Schema Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/explain-the-three-level-schema-architecture-in-dbms)

### Benefits of Three-Tier Architecture

-   **Scalability**: Scale each layer independently.
-   **Maintainability**: Update one layer without affecting others.
-   **Security**: Apply different security measures per layer.
-   **Flexibility**: Switch technologies easily.
-   **Performance**: Optimize each layer for its task.

### SMP vs. MPP Architecture

Think of these as two different ways to organize a team of workers:

**SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing)** - "The Shared Office"

-   **Analogy**: Like having multiple workers sharing one big desk with all the tools and files
-   **How it works**: Multiple processors (workers) share the same memory (desk space)
-   **Pros**:
    -   Easy to coordinate (everyone sees the same information)
    -   Simple to program (like giving instructions to a team in one room)
    -   Can add more workers easily (up to a point)
-   **Cons**:
    -   Limited by the size of the shared "desk" (memory)
    -   Workers might get in each other's way
-   **Best for**: Medium-sized applications, traditional databases
-   **Example**: A typical company database server

**MPP (Massively Parallel Processing)** - "The Distributed Team"

-   **Analogy**: Like having workers in different offices, each with their own desk, connected by phone/internet
-   **How it works**: Each processor has its own memory, connected by a network
-   **Pros**:
    -   Extremely scalable (can add unlimited "offices")
    -   No single point of failure (if one office goes down, others continue)
    -   Can handle massive amounts of data
-   **Cons**:
    -   Complex coordination (like managing a remote team)
    -   More expensive to set up and maintain
    -   Network communication can be slower than shared memory
-   **Best for**: Big data analytics, data warehouses, internet-scale applications
-   **Examples**: Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Netflix's recommendation system

**When to choose which:**

-   **Choose SMP** for: Traditional business applications, moderate data sizes, simpler setup
-   **Choose MPP** for: Big data analytics, need to process terabytes of data, internet-scale applications

### Bronze, Silver, Gold Layers

In **data warehouses**, data goes through a "refinement process" like mining precious metals - starting rough and becoming more valuable at each stage:

**🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)** - "The Mine"

-   **What it is**: Raw, unprocessed data straight from the source
-   **Analogy**: Like ore fresh from a mine - valuable but needs processing
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   Messy, inconsistent formats
    -   May contain errors, duplicates, missing values
    -   Exactly as received from source systems
-   **Who uses it**: Data engineers, technical teams
-   **Example**: Raw log files from a website, unfiltered customer data from different systems
-   **Purpose**: Historical backup, debugging, reprocessing if needed

**🥈 Silver Layer (Cleansed Data)** - "The Refinery"

-   **What it is**: Cleaned, validated, and standardized data
-   **Analogy**: Like refined silver - impurities removed, consistent quality
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   Standardized formats (dates, names, addresses)
    -   Duplicates removed
    -   Missing values handled
    -   Data quality rules applied
-   **Who uses it**: Data analysts, data scientists
-   **Example**: Customer data with standardized phone numbers, consistent date formats
-   **Purpose**: Reliable foundation for analysis and reporting

**🥇 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)** - "The Jewelry Store"

-   **What it is**: Optimized, aggregated, business-focused data
-   **Analogy**: Like finished jewelry - beautiful, ready for customers
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   Pre-calculated metrics and KPIs
    -   Organized by business domains
    -   Optimized for fast queries
    -   Easy to understand for business users
-   **Who uses it**: Business users, executives, dashboards
-   **Example**: Monthly sales reports, customer lifetime value, product performance metrics
-   **Purpose**: Direct business decision-making

**Real-world example - E-commerce company:**

-   **Bronze**: Raw clickstream data, order logs, inventory updates
-   **Silver**: Clean customer profiles, validated orders, standardized product catalog
-   **Gold**: Sales dashboards, customer segments, product recommendations

### Data Warehouse vs. Operational Database

-   **Data Warehouse**:
    -   For analytics and reporting.
    -   Denormalized schemas (Star/Snowflake).
    -   Complex queries, historical data.
-   **Operational Database**:
    -   For daily transactions (OLTP).
    -   Normalized schemas, real-time updates.

### Data Structures

-   **Structured**: Organized in tables (e.g., MySQL).
-   **Semi-Structured**: Flexible with tags (e.g., JSON in MongoDB).
-   **Unstructured**: No fixed format (e.g., files in Amazon S3).

## Week 4: SQL Wrap-Up

### Set Operations

Combine results from multiple queries:

-   **UNION**: Merges unique rows from two queries.
    ```sql
    SELECT emp_position FROM Employees
    UNION
    SELECT contractor_position FROM Contractors;
    ```
-   **EXCEPT (MINUS)**: Returns rows in the first query not in the second.
    ```sql
    SELECT emp_position FROM Employees
    EXCEPT
    SELECT contractor_position FROM Contractors;
    ```
-   **INTERSECT**: Returns common rows.
    ```sql
    SELECT emp_position FROM Employees
    INTERSECT
    SELECT contractor_position FROM Contractors;
    ```

### ACID Properties

**ACID** ensures reliable transactions:

-   **Atomicity**: Transactions complete fully or not at all (e.g., a bank transfer either happens or doesn’t).
-   **Consistency**: Ensures data follows rules (e.g., no negative balances).
-   **Isolation**: Transactions don’t interfere (e.g., one user’s transfer doesn’t affect another’s balance check).
-   **Durability**: Committed transactions are saved, even after crashes.

### Normalization

**Normalization** organizes data to reduce redundancy and ensure integrity:

-   **1NF (First Normal Form)**: No repeating groups, atomic values.
-   **2NF**: 1NF + non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.
-   **3NF**: 2NF + no non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes.
-   **BCNF**: A stricter version of 3NF.
-   **Example**: Split a table with customer, sales, and book data into separate tables to avoid duplication.

### Referential Integrity

Ensures relationships between tables stay consistent (e.g., foreign keys match primary keys). RDBMS enforces this with constraints, preventing invalid data or deletions that break links.

### Data Governance

**Data governance** manages data quality, security, and usability:

-   **Stewardship**: Assign stewards to maintain data quality and security.
-   **Management**: Handle data collection, storage, and access.
-   **Security**: Protect data with encryption, access controls, and compliance with laws.

### ETL vs. ELT

-   **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Transform data before loading into a warehouse. Suited for complex transformations.
-   **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: Load raw data, then transform in the warehouse. Faster for large datasets.
-   **Factors**: Technology, data volume, transformation complexity, latency, and cost.

### Incremental Load

Loads only new or updated data:

-   **Timestamp**: Use `createdAt` or `updatedAt` to track changes.
-   **Change Tracking**: Logs inserts, updates, deletes.
-   **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Tracks actual data changes.

### Upsert Logic

**Upsert** (Update or Insert):

-   Inserts new records or updates existing ones.
-   Example (PostgreSQL):
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John')
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET name = EXCLUDED.name;
    ```

## Week 5: Conceptual and Logical Modeling

### Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model)

An **ER Model** is like creating a blueprint before building a house - it helps you plan your database structure before writing any code.

**Real-world analogy**: Think of designing a school system. You need to figure out:

-   What "things" exist (students, teachers, courses, classrooms)
-   What information you need about each thing
-   How these things connect to each other

**Key Components Explained:**

**🏢 Entities** - "The Main Characters"

-   **What they are**: The "things" or "objects" your database will store information about
-   **Examples**: Students, Courses, Instructors, Classrooms, Books
-   **Think of them as**: Nouns in your business (people, places, things, concepts)
-   **In the database**: Each entity becomes a table

**📝 Attributes** - "The Details"

-   **What they are**: Properties or characteristics of entities
-   **Examples**:
    -   Student: `Student_ID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Date_of_Birth`, `GPA`
    -   Course: `Course_ID`, `Title`, `Credits`, `Department`
-   **Types**:
    -   **Simple**: Can't be broken down (like `Age`)
    -   **Composite**: Can be split (`Full Name` → `First Name` + `Last Name`)
    -   **Derived**: Calculated from other attributes (`Age` from `Date of Birth`)
-   **In the database**: Each attribute becomes a column

**🔗 Relationships** - "The Connections"

-   **What they are**: How entities connect to each other
-   **Examples**:
    -   Students ENROLL IN Courses
    -   Instructors TEACH Courses
    -   Students LIVE IN Dormitories
-   **Think of them as**: Verbs describing how things interact
-   **In the database**: Relationships are implemented using foreign keys

**🔢 Cardinality** - "How Many?"

-   **What it means**: How many instances of one entity can relate to another
-   **Types**:
    -   **One-to-One (1:1)**: Each student has one student ID card
    -   **One-to-Many (1:M)**: One instructor teaches many courses
    -   **Many-to-Many (M:M)**: Many students enroll in many courses
-   **Visual representation**: Lines with symbols (1, M, or crow's feet)

**⚡ Ordinality** - "Must Have or Optional?"

-   **What it means**: Minimum number of relationships required
-   **Examples**:
    -   A course MUST have at least one instructor (mandatory)
    -   A student MAY have a roommate (optional)
-   **Visual representation**: Single line (optional) or double line (mandatory)

**🔑 Keys** - "The Identifiers"

-   **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each entity instance
    -   Like a student ID number - no two students can have the same one
-   **Foreign Key**: Links to another entity's primary key
    -   Like putting the instructor's ID in the course table to show who teaches it

**Real-world example - University Database:**

```
STUDENT Entity:
- Attributes: StudentID (Primary Key), FirstName, LastName, Email, Major
- Relationships: ENROLLS IN courses, LIVES IN dormitory

COURSE Entity:
- Attributes: CourseID (Primary Key), Title, Credits, Department
- Relationships: TAUGHT BY instructor, ENROLLED BY students

INSTRUCTOR Entity:
- Attributes: InstructorID (Primary Key), Name, Department, Office
- Relationships: TEACHES courses
```

**Why ER Models matter:**

-   Helps you think through your data before building
-   Prevents costly mistakes later
-   Makes it easier to communicate with others
-   Ensures you don't forget important relationships

### ERD Types

-   **Conceptual ERD**: High-level, no data types, focuses on entities and relationships.
-   **Logical ERD**: Adds column types, primary/foreign keys, and normalization.
-   **Physical ERD**: Final blueprint, specific to the DBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL’s `createdAt` fields).

### External Tables

**External tables** point to data outside the database (e.g., CSV files, Amazon S3):

-   **Pros**: No data duplication, cost-effective, supports varied formats.
-   **Cons**: Slower performance, limited features, security challenges.
-   **PostgreSQL Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS file_fdw;
    CREATE SERVER csv_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER file_fdw;
    CREATE FOREIGN TABLE employees_external (
        id INTEGER,
        name TEXT,
        department TEXT,
        salary FLOAT
    )
    SERVER csv_server
    OPTIONS (
        FORMAT 'csv',
        HEADER 'true',
        FILENAME '/path/to/your/csv/file.csv'
    );
    ```
-   **S3 Example**: Use `s3_fdw` to connect to Amazon S3 (requires third-party module).
-   **Security Considerations**: Authentication, access control, data validation, encryption, and compliance with laws (e.g., data sovereignty for medical data).

## Week 6: Query Optimization and Cloud Administration

### Partitioning Tables

**Partitioning** splits a large table into smaller pieces for better performance:

-   **Types**:
    -   **Range**: By value ranges (e.g., sales by year).
    -   **List**: By specific values (e.g., by country).
    -   **Hash**: Uses a hash function to distribute data evenly.
    -   **Composite**: Combines multiple types.
-   **Benefits**: Faster queries, easier maintenance, scalability.

### Hash Functions

A **hash function** is like a magical filing system that can take any piece of information and give it a unique "address" or "fingerprint."

**Real-world analogy**: Think of a hash function like a library's book numbering system:

-   You give it a book title (input): "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
-   It gives you back a shelf number (hash): "A47B92"
-   No matter how many times you ask, the same book always gets the same shelf number
-   Different books get different shelf numbers

**How it works in simple terms:**

1. **Input**: Any data (text, numbers, files)
2. **Process**: Mathematical formula scrambles the data
3. **Output**: Fixed-size "fingerprint" (like a postal code)

**Why hash functions are useful:**

**1. Fast Data Retrieval** - "Finding Things Quickly"

-   **Without hashing**: Search through every record (like looking through every book on every shelf)
-   **With hashing**: Jump directly to the right location (like going straight to shelf A47B92)
-   **Example**: Finding your account in a bank's database of millions of customers

**2. Data Integrity** - "Detecting Changes"

-   **How it works**: If data changes even slightly, the hash changes completely
-   **Example**: Verifying a downloaded file hasn't been corrupted
-   **Like**: A tamper-evident seal that breaks if someone opens the package

**3. Load Balancing** - "Distributing Work Evenly"

-   **How it works**: Use hash values to decide which server handles which data
-   **Example**: Customer names A-H go to Server 1, I-P go to Server 2, etc.
-   **Like**: Assigning students to different classrooms based on their last names

**4. Password Security** - "Protecting Sensitive Information"

-   **How it works**: Store the hash of passwords, not the actual passwords
-   **Example**: Your password "MySecret123" becomes "7A8B9C2D1E3F"
-   **Benefit**: Even if hackers steal the database, they can't see actual passwords

**Key Properties (What Makes a Good Hash Function):**

-   **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
-   **Fast**: Quick to calculate
-   **Uniform**: Spreads data evenly across possible outputs
-   **One-way**: Easy to compute hash from data, nearly impossible to reverse

### Cloud Database Security and Privacy

-   **Authentication**: Use usernames, MFA, or RBAC (e.g., AWS IAM).
-   **Encryption**: In-transit (SSL/TLS) and at-rest (AWS KMS).
-   **Auditing**: Log activities with AWS CloudTrail, monitor with CloudWatch.
-   **Firewall/Network**: Use Security Groups, VPCs for isolation.
-   **Data Masking/Anonymization**: Protect sensitive data.
-   **Backups**: Regular snapshots, Multi-AZ for recovery.
-   **Privacy**: Classify data, ensure compliance (e.g., GDPR), manage data sovereignty.

### Cloud Database Recovery

Protects against:

-   Hardware/software failures, human errors, natural disasters, cyberattacks.
-   **Recovery Types**:
    -   **Backup/Restore**: Regular backups for recovery.
    -   **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to a specific moment.
    -   **Failover**: Switch to a standby database.
    -   **Replication**: Keep real-time copies.
-   **Objectives**:
    -   **RPO**: How much data loss is acceptable?
    -   **RTO**: How quickly must recovery happen?
-   **Steps**: Plan, implement, test, monitor, update.

### Cloud Database Auto-Scaling

**Auto-scaling** adjusts resources dynamically:

-   **Types**:
    -   **Horizontal**: Add more instances (scaling out).
    -   **Vertical**: Increase instance power (scaling up).
    -   **Read/Write**: Scale reads with replicas, writes with stronger nodes.
    -   **Scheduled/Dynamic/Predictive**: Based on schedules, metrics, or predictions.
-   **Pros**: Cost-efficient, reliable, high performance.
-   **Cons**: Latency, cost monitoring, consistency challenges.

### Cloud Database Mirroring

**Mirroring** keeps real-time database copies:

-   **Components**: Principal server (main), mirror server (copy), optional witness.
-   **Types**:
    -   **Synchronous**: Ensures data consistency, may add latency.
    -   **Asynchronous**: Faster, with slight data lag.
-   **Pros**: High availability, data protection, load balancing.
-   **Cons**: Latency, cost, complexity.

### Failover Clusters

**Failover clusters** ensure availability by switching to standby nodes:

-   **Components**: Nodes, shared storage, cluster software, networking.
-   **Types**: Active/Passive, Active/Active, N+1.
-   **Pros**: High availability, scalability.
-   **Cons**: Complex, costly, data consistency challenges.

-   Immutable VPC but flexible subnets.

### Private vs. Public VPCs

-   **Public VPC**: Subnets with internet access (e.g., for web servers).
-   **Private VPC**: No direct internet access, uses NAT or VPN (e.g., for databases).
-   **Hybrid**: Combines public and private subnets.

### VPC Security Best Practices

-   **Least Privilege**: Limit access.
-   **VPC Flow Logs**: Monitor traffic.
-   **NACLs/Security Groups**: Control traffic.

## Week 9: Introduction to NoSQL and MongoDB

### What is NoSQL?

**NoSQL** (Not Only SQL) databases are like flexible storage containers that can adapt to whatever you put in them, unlike traditional SQL databases which are like rigid filing cabinets with fixed compartments.

**Real-world analogy**:

-   **SQL Database**: Like a traditional office filing system with labeled folders, specific forms, and strict rules about what goes where
-   **NoSQL Database**: Like a modern storage unit where you can put boxes of any size and shape, and organize them however makes sense for your stuff

**Key advantages of NoSQL**:

-   **Scale**: Can spread data across many computers (like having multiple storage units)
-   **Schema-less**: No fixed structure - you can store different types of data without redesigning everything
-   **Performance**: Optimized for specific tasks (like finding things quickly vs. complex analysis)
-   **Flexibility**: Easy to change and adapt as your needs evolve

**When to use NoSQL**:

-   Social media posts (different formats, lots of users)
-   Product catalogs (varying product attributes)
-   Real-time analytics (need speed over complex relationships)
-   Mobile apps (need to work offline and sync later)

### Types of NoSQL Databases

Think of these as different types of storage solutions for different needs:

**1. Document Databases** (like MongoDB)

-   **Analogy**: Like storing complete files in folders, where each file can have different contents
-   **What it stores**: JSON-like documents (think of them as digital forms that can have different fields)
-   **Best for**: Product catalogs, user profiles, content management
-   **Example**: Storing customer information where some customers have different fields (some have phone numbers, others don't)

**2. Key-Value Databases** (like Redis)

-   **Analogy**: Like a giant dictionary or phone book - you look up a name (key) to get information (value)
-   **What it stores**: Simple pairs: "customer123" → customer data
-   **Best for**: Caching (storing frequently accessed data), session management, shopping carts
-   **Example**: Storing user login sessions

**3. Column Databases** (like Cassandra)

-   **Analogy**: Like a spreadsheet where you can add columns dynamically and efficiently store sparse data
-   **What it stores**: Data organized by columns rather than rows
-   **Best for**: Time-series data, IoT sensor data, analytics
-   **Example**: Storing temperature readings from thousands of sensors over time

**4. Graph Databases** (like Neo4j)

-   **Analogy**: Like a social network map showing how people are connected
-   **What it stores**: Nodes (entities) and edges (relationships)
-   **Best for**: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection
-   **Example**: "Alice is friends with Bob, who works at Company X, which is located in City Y"

### NoSQL Data Example

```json
{
	"id": "1",
	"username": "JohnDoe",
	"email": "john.doe@email.com",
	"password": "2bgh54h3b124b13b1h3b12h4"
}
```

### SQL vs NoSQL: When to Use What?

**Choose SQL (Relational) when you need**:

-   **Strict data consistency** (like banking - every transaction must be perfect)
-   **Complex relationships** between data (like a school system with students, courses, teachers, grades all connected)
-   **Well-defined structure** that won't change much
-   **ACID compliance** (transactions that must be 100% reliable)
-   **Examples**: Banking systems, inventory management, payroll systems

**Choose NoSQL when you need**:

-   **Flexibility** to change data structure frequently
-   **Massive scale** (millions of users, huge amounts of data)
-   **Speed** over perfect consistency
-   **Different types of data** in the same system
-   **Examples**: Social media platforms, content management, real-time analytics, mobile apps

### BASE Properties

NoSQL often uses **BASE** instead of ACID (think of it as being more relaxed about perfection in exchange for speed and flexibility):

-   **Basically Available**: System stays accessible even if some parts fail (like a website that still works even if one server goes down)
-   **Soft State**: Data might be in transition and changing (like social media feeds that update gradually)
-   **Eventually Consistent**: Data becomes consistent over time, but might be slightly different across locations temporarily (like how a viral post might take a few seconds to appear on all users' feeds)

**Real-world example**: When you post on social media, your friends might see it at slightly different times, but eventually everyone sees the same post. This is "eventual consistency" - good enough for social media, but not acceptable for bank transfers!

### ACID vs. BASE

-   **ACID**: Prioritizes consistency (e.g., banking).
-   **BASE**: Prioritizes availability (e.g., social media).
-   **Behavior**: ACID rolls back on failure; BASE continues with possible outdated data.

### NoSQL vs. RDBMS

-   **NoSQL**: Dynamic schema, no standard query language, BASE.
-   **RDBMS**: Fixed schema, SQL, ACID.

### MongoDB Overview

**MongoDB** is a document-based NoSQL database:

-   **Document-Based**: Stores data in BSON (Binary JSON).
-   **Schema-less**: Flexible document structures.
-   **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across servers.
-   **Speed**: Fast reads/writes by storing related data together.

### MongoDB Special Data Types

-   **ObjectId**: Unique document identifier.
-   **ISODate**: Stores dates (e.g., `ISODate("2023-08-17T00:00:00Z")`).
-   **Timestamp**: Non-real-world time tracking.

### MongoDB CRUD Operations

Using MongoDB’s Node.js driver:

-   **Create**:
    ```javascript
    db.collection("students").insertOne({ name: "John Doe" });
    db.collection("students").insertMany([{ name: "John Doe" }, { name: "Jane Smith" }]);
    ```
-   **Read**:
    ```javascript
    db.collection("students").find({}); // All records
    db.collection("students").findOne({ name: "John Doe" }); // One record
    db.collection("students").find({ name: /^John/ }); // Names starting with 'John'
    ```
-   **Update**:
    ```javascript
    db.collection("students").updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $set: { grade: 12 } }); // Updates one record
    db.collection("students").updateMany({ name: /^John/ }, { $set: { status: "graduated" } }); // Updates multiple
    ```
-   **Delete**:
    ```javascript
    db.collection("students").deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" });
    db.collection("students").deleteMany({ status: "graduated" });
    ```

### MongoDB Joins

Use `$lookup` to join collections:

```javascript
db.students.aggregate([
	{
		$lookup: {
			from: "grades",
			localField: "id",
			foreignField: "student_id",
			as: "studentGrades",
		},
	},
]);
```

_Explanation_: Joins `students` with `grades` using `id` and `student_id`.

### MongoDB Array Operations

-   **Insert Array**:
    ```javascript
    db.students.insertOne({
    	name: "John Doe",
    	subjects: ["English", "Math"],
    });
    ```
-   **Add to Array**:
    ```javascript
    db.students.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $push: { subjects: "French" } });
    db.students.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $push: { subjects: { $each: ["French", "Physics"] } } });
    ```
-   **Remove from Array**:

## Week 11: Applications of Machine Learning

### Physical Denormalization

**Normalization** reduces redundancy but can slow queries due to joins. **Denormalization** adds redundant data to speed up queries:

-   **Example**: Instead of joining `Orders` and `Products` tables, store product names in `Orders` to avoid joins, trading redundancy for speed.
-   **Trade-offs**: Faster queries but more storage and potential inconsistency.

### Query Execution

Steps in running a SQL query:

1. **Parsing**: Check syntax.
2. **Optimization**: Choose the fastest plan using indexes and data size.
3. **Execution**: Run the plan (e.g., scan tables, join data).
4. **Presentation**: Format and return results.
   Denormalization reduces joins, speeding up execution.

### Distributed Architecture

**Distributed architecture** splits tasks across multiple computers:

-   **Scalability**: Add machines to handle more load.
-   **Fault Tolerance**: System works if one node fails.
-   **Latency**: Place resources closer to users.
-   **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple nodes process tasks simultaneously.
-   **Types**:
    -   **Client-Server**: Clients request from a central server.
    -   **Three-Tier**: Adds a middle tier for logic.
    -   **Peer-to-Peer**: Nodes act as both clients and servers.
    -   **Master-Slave**: Master directs slave nodes.
    -   **Microservices**: Independent services communicate.
    -   **Grid Computing**: Nodes solve large problems.
    -   **Lambda/Kappa**: For big data processing.
    -   **Blockchain**: Distributed ledger with consensus.

### Challenges

-   **Data Consistency**: Ensuring all nodes have the same data.
-   **Network Partition**: Handling network failures.
-   **Security**: Protecting multiple nodes.
-   **Resource Management**: Allocating tasks efficiently.

### Machine Learning in Databases

**Machine learning (ML)** enhances databases by:

-   **Handling Data Volume**: Automates analysis of large datasets.
-   **Real-Time Analytics**: Speeds up decision-making.
-   **Complex Queries**: Optimizes joins and subqueries.
-   **Data Quality**: Cleans dirty or missing data.

### ML Applications

-   **Query Optimization**:
    -   Predicts best join order or index usage.
    -   Optimizes caching based on usage patterns.
-   **Data Compression**:
    -   Recognizes patterns for efficient compression.
    -   Chooses lossy vs. lossless compression.
-   **Data Sharding**:
    -   Analyzes query patterns to minimize cross-shard queries.
    -   Balances shards to avoid bottlenecks.
-   **Data Partitioning**:
    -   Predicts load to optimize partitioning.
    -   Clusters data for faster access.

### Google BigQuery ML

Integrates ML into databases for query optimization and analytics.

### Future of ML in Databases

-   **In-Database ML**: Run models within the database.
-   **Distributed ML**: Scale ML across nodes.
-   **Adaptive Optimization**: Continuously improve queries.
-   **Security**: Detect threats in real-time.
-   **Explainable AI**: Transparent ML models.

## Summary: Your Database Journey

Congratulations! You've learned about the fundamental concepts of databases. Here's a quick recap of your journey:

### Week 1-2: The Basics

-   **Databases** are organized systems for storing and retrieving data
-   **SQL** is the language for talking to relational databases
-   **Basic operations** (CRUD): Create, Read, Update, Delete data
-   **Tables, rows, and columns** are the building blocks of relational databases

### Week 3-4: Getting More Advanced

-   **Database architecture** is like city planning for data
-   **Normalization** reduces data redundancy and improves integrity
-   **Joins** connect related data across multiple tables
-   **Aggregate functions** summarize data (count, sum, average)

### Week 5-6: Design and Optimization

-   **ER models** help design database structure before building
-   **Indexes** speed up data retrieval (like a book's index)
-   **Query optimization** makes databases run faster

## Additional Beginner Tips and Tricks

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Forgetting WHERE clauses**

```sql
-- DANGEROUS - This deletes ALL students!
DELETE FROM Students;

-- SAFE - This deletes only one specific student
DELETE FROM Students WHERE student_id = 123;
```

**2. Not backing up data before major changes**

-   Always create a backup before running UPDATE or DELETE commands
-   Test queries on a small dataset first

**3. Choosing the wrong data types**

-   Use `VARCHAR(50)` for names, not `VARCHAR(1000)` (wastes space)
-   Use `INT` for whole numbers, `DECIMAL` for money amounts
-   Use `DATE` for dates, not storing them as text

**4. Creating too many indexes**

-   Indexes speed up SELECT but slow down INSERT/UPDATE
-   Only create indexes on columns you frequently search

**5. Not understanding NULL values**

-   `NULL` is not the same as empty string `''` or zero `0`
-   Use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`, not `= NULL`

### Quick Reference: When to Use What
